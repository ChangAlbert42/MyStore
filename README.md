Learning how to create an ASP.NET Core Web Application connecting to SQL Server 2022 database and implementing CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

Changed code for "created_at" since error was being thrown for DateTime to String conversion.
Modify connection string to database: keyword "Trust Server Certificate" has been updated to "TrustServerCertificate"
Created using Razor pages instead of MVC design.
